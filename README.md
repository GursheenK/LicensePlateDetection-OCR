# License Plate Detection Using OCR.

Vehicle Number Plate Detection aims at detection of the License Plate present on a vehicle and then extracting the contents of that License Plate. A vehicle’s license plate is commonly known as ‘a number plate’. It is a metal plate that is attached to a vehicle and has the official registration number of a vehicle embossed on it. Number plates are placed at the front and back of the vehicle and help anyone to identify a vehicle.
